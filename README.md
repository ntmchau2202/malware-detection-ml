# Malware detection using Decision Tree & Random Forest

This project intends to investigate on building Decision Tree using CART algorithm and Random Forest from scratch, as well as investigating on hyperparameters impact on models' behavior, and finding a set of proper hyperparameters for improving quality of models.

## Structure

The project consists of 

- `README.md`: This file, to explain in brief about the project and how can it be run
- `scratch`: Folder for scratch decision tree and random forest implementation
- `training`: Folder for scripts and results of experiments on CART and Random Forest with TensorFlow. Graphs and raw result can be found here
- `resources`: Folder for the project's dataset
- `report`: Folder for project's report and presentation files

## Setup & Run

All files in this project should be run on Google Collab. 

- Download the source codes in `src.zip` archive and extract it
- Upload `.ipynb` files onto Google Collab
- All the dependencies has been defined in each files, so no need to have further configuration
- The (previous) experiment results should have been put in the notebook. This can be used as a reference to the report. Else, we can run it again to get the outputs.
- Run the file from beginning in order for the environment variables to be initialized properly. Training, testing and graphs results will be plot right on the notebook
- If any training/testing/graphing cells are disrupted while being run, just reload that cell only. In case Google Collab notifies errors, run the notebook from begining again - because the local variables might have been lost.

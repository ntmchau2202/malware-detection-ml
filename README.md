# Malware detection using Decision Tree & Random Forest

This project intends to investigate on building Decision Tree using CART algorithm and Random Forest from scratch, as well as investigating on hyperparameters impact on models' behavior, and finding a set of proper hyperparameters for improving quality of models.

## Structure

The project consists of 

- `README.md`: This file, to explain in brief about the project and how can it be run
- `scratch_impl`: Folder for scratch decision tree and random forest implementation
- `hp_effect`: Folder for scripts and results of evaluating impact of hyperparameters on models
    - `script`: Folder of `.py` scripts for running evaluation of hyperparameters on CART and Random Forest
        - `plot`: Folder of `.ipynb` notebooks for drawing evaluation results
    - `res`: Folder of `.json` evaluation results 
    - `img`: Folder of `.png` image files for illustrate evaluation results 
- `tuning`: Folder for scripts and results of tuning hyperparameters for models
    - `script`: Folder of `.py` scripts for runing tuning
    - `res`: Folder `.json` tuning results
- `resources`: Folder for the project's dataset
- `report`: Folder for project's report and presentation files

## Setup & Run

All files in this project should be run on Google Collab. 

- For the `.ipynb` scripts in `scratch_impl`, `hp_effect` and `tuning`, simply upload them to Google Collab and run. All dependencies are defined at the top of each file. Google Collab will automatically download them for execution
- For the `.ipynb` notebook in `plot`, please put their corresponding `.json` result file at the same place as the notebook before running
